These external crates require a specific set of parameter files to be located at in a specific folder. By default, it is `/var/tmp/filecoin-proof-parameters` but it can be overridden by the `FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE` environment variable. Forest will automatically download the parameter files from IPFS and verify their validity. For consistency, Forest will prefer to download the files itâ€™s local data directory. To this end, the `FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE` environment variable is updated before the parameters are downloaded."]]};
